to start a service:

service httpd start - starting a httpd service

or 

systemctl start httpd 

systemctl stop httpd - stop the service

systemctl status httpd - check the status of the service

systemctl enable httpd - Configure httpd to start at startup

systemctl disable httpd - configure httpd to not start at startup


Exmaple:

Inorder to start a simple python application -

	/usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/my_app.py

	(curl https://localhost:5000 - Hello,world!)

instead of doing like this giving the paths everytime and running the application we can simply follow below procedure:

in /etc/systemd/system

create a service called: my_app.service

	[Service]
	ExecStart = /usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/my_app.py

Now we have configured our command with ctl

Now run systemctl daemon-reload (to system know new service created)

systemctl start my_app
systemctl status my_app
systemctl stop my_app
